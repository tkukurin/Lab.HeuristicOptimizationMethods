# HMO genetic algorithm solver

## TODOs

[ ] Output results and fitness after running (1, 5, +inf) minutes
[ ] Try out making a "smarter" finisher in Main
[ ] Test out different GA parameters
[ ] Try adding other mutation / combination methods in `SmarterGenerator` (for instance, would be
cool to try out sorting tracks by evaluating them in different ways and using that metric to
combine)
[ ] Write documentation
